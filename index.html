						<p>Lukas Kruegle is a third year computer engineering student at Northeastern University. His experience in the security hardware and medical devices fields, along with his passion for Music and Art, informs his mindful, and detail oriented approach to problem solving.
							<br><br>
						His time at <a href="http://avidasw.com/">Avida Securityworks</a> fuelled his desire to learn more about the engineering process and various technologies. He highly values time he spends teaching himself new, useful skills. This, along with his competing artistic passions, have led Lukas to be an adaptable, quick learner who is ready to pivot to fit the needs of whatever is tasked to him. Whether it be developing a touchscreen UI in C for a system at Avida, learning to record and mix music in his spare time, or learning about fundamental algorithms in his coursework, his drive to learn pushes him forward.
							<br><br>
						In his free time, Lukas loves to listen to and create music. He recently began a dive into the (incredibly overpriced) world of audiophilia, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/lukaskay/collection">collecting vinyl records</a> and headphones. He also loves to sing and play various instruments.
							<br><br>
						Another of his passions is Theatre. He has been involved in a number of shows, from the shows put on by his highschool theatre department, <a href="https://www.pvhstheatre.org/">Pascack Valley Theatre Company</a>, to his time developing student produced and performed shows with <a href="https://nustage.squarespace.com/">NU Stage</a>, he has always loved being on stage.
